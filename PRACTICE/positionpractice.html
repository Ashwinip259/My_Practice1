    The introduction of birds says that they are an organization of Aves-class warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by wings, hard-shelled egg-laying, toothless beaked jaws, an increased metabolic rate, a heart with four chambers, and a powerful yet light skeleton. The bird's scientific name is Aves. Birds are found worldwide and vary in measurements from the bee hummingbird 5.5 cm (2.2 in) to the ostrich 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in).


In the bird background, there are approximately ten thousand life forms, of which more than half are passerine or perching birds. Birds possess feathers whose development varies by species; the extinct moa and elephant birds are the only known groups with no wings.


Also, birds' digestive and respiratory systems are emerging for flight. Some aquatic bird species, especiallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy seabirds and some waterbirds, have adapted further for swimming purposes.
